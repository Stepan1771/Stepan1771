# 👋 Hey, I'm Stepan

I'm a **Python developer** who likes turning complex ideas into clean, maintainable code.  
I care about **architecture**, **DX**, and things that don’t break on Friday evenings.

- State management, performance, UI logic

**Backend**
- Node.js, REST / GraphQL
- PostgreSQL, Prisma

**Other**
